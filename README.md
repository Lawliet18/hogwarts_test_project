# hogwarts_test_project

I used a simple widgets without customization fo UI

- Clean Architecture
- BLoC/Cubit as a state manager
- auto_route for navigation
- shared_preferences to save data locally on user' phones(database longer to implement)
- freezed + json_serializable for code generation
- dio for API calls
- theme as a bonus
